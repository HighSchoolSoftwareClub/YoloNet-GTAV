**About GTA:Online:**
Do NOT use this online. Although there is no checks if you use this online or not in script (it is open-source, it'd take 10 secs to remove check), rockstar can still detect and ban you. I am not responsible if you get banned.

**How to install:**

**0)** Understand that you'll use it at your own risk.

*Skip to 2 if you have ScriptHookV, skip to 3 if you have both SHV.Net and SHV.*

**1)** Download and install ScriptHookV: http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/

**2-1)** Download https://github.com/crosire/scripthookvdotnet's latest release / download current version's source code and compile.

**2-2)** Install it by copying the .asi and .dll file to GTA V folder.

**3)** Download the .cs file (and the txt files if you want all the features) and copy it to the /scripts/ folder under your GTAV folder. (if it doesn't exist, create it)

**Done.** *It opens with F6 key.*
